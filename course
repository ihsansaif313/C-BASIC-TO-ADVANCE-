Day 1: Basics and Control Structures

1. Session 1 : Introduction to C++
   - Basics of C++ programming
   - Setting up the development environment
   - Simple input/output operations
   - Exercise: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

2. Session 2 : Control Structures
   - Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
   - Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
   - Exercise: Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

3. Session 3 : Functions and Scope
   - Function declaration and definition
   - Function parameters and return values
   - Variable scope and lifetime
   - Exercise: Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial.

Day 2: Advanced Concepts and Data Structures

1. Session 4: Pointers and Arrays
   - Introduction to pointers
   - Arrays and pointer arithmetic
   - Dynamic memory allocation
   - Exercise: Write a program that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

2. Session 5 : Object-Oriented Programming
   - Classes and objects
   - Constructors and destructors
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
   - Exercise: Create a class called Student with properties for name, age, and grade. Write a method to display student details.

3. Session 6 : Data Structures
   - Arrays and linked lists
   - Stacks and queues
   - Exercise: Implement a singly linked list with methods to insert, delete, and display elements.

Day 3: Algorithms, Recursion, and Complexity

1. Session 7 : Sorting and Searching Algorithms
   - Basic sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort)
   - Basic searching algorithms (linear search, binary search)
   - Exercise: Write a program that sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.

2. Session 8 : Recursion and Dynamic Programming
   - Concept of recursion
   - Examples of recursive functions
   - Introduction to dynamic programming
   - Exercise: Write a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

3. Session 9 : Trees and Graphs
   - Binary trees and tree traversal
   - Binary search trees (BST)
   - Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
   - Exercise: Write a program to perform in-order traversal of a binary tree.

4. Session 10 : Complexity Analysis and Review
   - Time and space complexity
   - Big O notation
   - Exercise: Analyze the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm and explain it.

Final Session: Project Presentation

- Session 11 
   - Students present their final projects
